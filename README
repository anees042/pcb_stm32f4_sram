Schematics and PCB for an STM32F4-board with external SRAM and micro-SD card.

The board is designed around the STM32F40X ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller in
LQFP-144 package. This package has full support for the built-in external
memory controller (FSMC).

Provision is provided for up to 4 SRAM modules, giving up to 16MByte of
external SRAM. Any number of the SRAM modules can be fitted or not, as
desired.

The SRAM chip used is Cypress CY621X7. This chip exists in three different
pin-compatible sizes, which allows flexibility between available memory and
component costs:

  CY62157EV30    0.5M x 16  (1 MByte / IC)
  CY62167EV30      1M x 16  (2 MByte / IC)
  CY62177EV30      2M x 16  (4 MByte / IC)

(The cost for provisioning the full 16MByte with 4 x CY62177EV30 is around
$185. A single CY62157EV30 (1MByte) is around $10).

A micro-SD card slot is also provided, connected to allow 4-bit 25MHz
operation (total of 100MBit data transfer max).

A micro-USB is connected. Power can come either from USB or from a standard
power jack, selectable by a jumper (an on-board 500mA 3.3V LDO linear voltage
regulator is on the board).

All GPIO are exposed on 4 16x2 dual pin headers. 7 of the 8 16-pin rows are
dedicated to PA0-15, PB0-15, ..., PG0-15. The final row is dedicated to
exposed GND/3.3V/5V pins and 6 pins for ST-LINK V2 / SWD programming (for
programming eg. with STM32F4 Discovery board in external programmer mode).


ToDo: The idea is to lay out the board as 4-sided, around 10x10 cm or smaller,
and order it from SeeedStudio.
